			<p >As one of the most respected potters of the 20th century, Dame Lucie Rie (1902-1995) was known for her finely thrown and beautifully decorated functional domestic ceramics.

She emigrated to the UK during the Second World War and began producing ceramic buttons for the fashion industry, after spotting a gap in the market as many British button factories had been requisitioned for the War effort.

This exhibition at the Centre of Ceramic Art (CoCA), York Art Gallery highlights this less well known area of her practice, displaying hundreds of her beautiful buttons alongside many examples of domestic wares she became celebrated for.

			<p >20th-century design was profoundly shaped and enhanced by the creativity of women—as muses of modernity and shapers of new ways of living, and as designers, patrons, performers, and educators. This installation, drawn entirely from MoMA’s collection, celebrates the diversity and vitality of individual artists’ approach to the modern world, from Loïe Fuller’s pulsating turn-of-the-century performances to April Greiman’s 1980s computer-generated graphics, at the vanguard of early digital design. Highlights include the first display of a newly conserved kitchen by Charlotte Perriand with Le Corbusier (1952) from the Unité d’Habitation housing project; furniture and designs by Lilly Reich, Eileen Gray, Eva Zeisel, Ray Eames, Lella Vignelli, and Denise Scott Brown; textiles by Anni Albers and Eszter Haraszty; ceramics by Lucie Rie; a display of 1960s psychedelic concert posters by graphic designer Bonnie Maclean; and a never-before-seen selection of posters and graphic material from the punk era.

			<p >Lucie Rie (1902 - 1995), one of the twentieth century’s greatest studio potters, devoted her life to creating ceramic works of art that brim with a fresh sense of surprise and discovery.
Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna, Lucie fell under the spell of the potter’s wheel while studying at the Kunstgewerbeschule, the art school attached to the Wiener Werkstatte. 
This exhibition traces the creative path of Lucie Rie, one of the twentieth century’s greatest studio potters, presenting a superb collection of approximately 250 pieces from Japan and abroad. As the first full-scale posthumous retrospective of her work, this exhibition also includes a wealth of related materials, including handwritten notes and letters as well as photographs, contributed by scholarly institutions in Britain.
